## Black Box

*The following are black box challenge.  You will be presented with boxes of hidden possibilities.  Sniff them and enumerate them.  You will need to figure out what it is and how it is doing it.*

Possible Tools: Audacity, RTL433, URH,

## Box_1

## Box_2

Port Range 658X-658X is running some kind of consumer wireless system.
There are three signals that have been captured.
Two signals are a medium command one is a low command.
All three of the signals came from the same remote. The difference is that Signal 1 came from the remote with dip switch 2 flipped to on. Signal 2 had the dip switch in position 3 and signal 3 came from the dip switch position 4 on.
this is a picture of the remote:

Flag 1: Tells us the fcc ID number for this remote with no spaces all lower case

Flag 2: send the hex code bits 1-9 of the medium power command no spaces all lower case

Flag 3: send us the hex code bits 1-9 for a low power signal from the remote as you see it in the picture.

ZeroMQ (also known as Ã˜MQ, 0MQ, or zmq) looks like an embeddable networking library but acts like a concurrency framework. It gives you sockets that carry atomic messages across various transports like in-process, inter-process, TCP, and multicast. You can connect sockets N-to-N with patterns like fan-out, pub-sub, task distribution, and request-reply. It's fast enough to be the fabric for clustered products. Its asynchronous I/O model gives you scalable multicore applications, built as asynchronous message-processing tasks. It has a score of language APIs and runs on most operating systems.
