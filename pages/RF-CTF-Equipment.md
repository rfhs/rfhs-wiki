## King of the Hill

The Wifi King of the hill Challenge requires users to connect to the RFHS_RFCTF_KingOfTheHill Wifi network and submit their team name to the webpage hoted on the router. 
When a team is able to successfully connect to the network and submit their team name, the scoring system will record their submission, and then stop broadcasting the network for 60 seconds.
After 60 seconds gone by the AP will resume broadcsting the King of the Hill access point and then teams can attempt to connect to the access point and submit their team name to the web page again.
For the duration of the CTF the router will continue to run and and cycles its brodcastings for 60 seconds after a team has connected and submitted their name, always coming back up on a random channel and with a random MAC addess.

Scoring works by taking the total number of team name submissions to the page hosted on the ap and dividing the points the challenge is worth up proportionally up amongst the teams that submitted their team name successfully.


New players potentially beware: Some long time veteran teams have dedicated hard ware designed to automatically connect and submit their team names to the web page, so it may take you some time to see this AP if automated hardware is being run. Additionaly players should look out for teams running rogue APs that are pretending to be be the one hosted by the RFHS. You can submit your team name to rogue AP, but the RFHS wont award you any proportional points for you effort

## LRS Pagers
Long Range Systems manufacture several versions of pagers and paging devices. At the table you may notice something similar to the on in this image:

Each pager is similar to what you would find at a restaurant. Check the scoreboard for what challenges are live, but if you see this you might need to receive and or transmit packets to and from these devices. LRS usually involves a restaurant id, and a pager id. These numbers are useful and you should figure out how to find them and use them
